Description:
    Creates dummy urls for the application. It generates groups of urls,
    composed of one GET, one POST, one PUT and one DELETE requests which hit
    the default routes for every model.
    
    The amount of groups of urls created for each model depends on the amount
    of records created by Dummy's data generator (yes, this generator depends on
    it). By default, it uses 10 as a divisor but this value can be user-defined.
    For instance, if Dummy's data generator created 20 records for a given model
    and Dummy's route generator is using the default divisor (10), it will generate
    2 groups of routes for that model.

Example:
    `rails generate dummy:urls`

    Creates urls stored in YAML files for every model.
    
        Routes: test/dummy/urls/*
        Dummyfile: test/dummy/Dummyfile
        
    `rails generate dummy:urls --divisor=3`

    Creates urls for every model using a 3 divisor, instead of the default (10).
    
    `rails generate dummy:urls --manual-amounts`
    
    Asks for the amount of groups of urls to generate for each model.

    `rails generate dummy:urls --output-folder=test/awesome_dummy`
    
    Creates urls for every model and places them in test/awesome_dummy/urls.
